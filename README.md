# Dashboard

:arrow_forward: **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy.github.io/dashboard/)**

Mockup dashboard layout of a fictional website that features a social media-like interface where the user can interact with their own project notes, view the website's announcements and keep in touch with other users' updates. The design was almost entirely made with CSS grid as practice, even though it's not the most optimal tool for every case. It is fully responsive.
